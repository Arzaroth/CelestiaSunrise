{"name":"Celestiasunrise","tagline":"Savegame editor for the mobile game \"My Little Pony\"","body":"### What is it?\r\n\r\nCelestia Sunrise is a savegame editor for the quite popular \"My little Pony\" mobile game.\r\n\r\nIt provides both a graphical interface (suitable for most users) and a command-line interface (for people like who only use something that works in their shell).\r\n\r\nIt currently only works for Android devices, but I plan to introduce iOS compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\n\r\nIf you are a Linux user:\r\n- > git clone https://github.com/Arzaroth/CelestiaSunrise.git\r\n- > cd CelestiaSunrise\r\n- > python3.4 -m venv .\r\n- > . bin/activate\r\n- > pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n- > python CelestiaSunrise.py -g\r\n- Profit !\r\n\r\nNote that I recommend you to take a look at [pew](https://github.com/berdario/pew) for your virtualenvs management.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Windows user:\r\n- Download and unzip latest release. Write down where you put the uncompressed folder (the one containing a requirements.txt file).\r\n- Install python from [here](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). Be sure to check the \"Add anaconda to my PATH environment variable\" checkbox.\r\n- Open a console (the \"cmd\" program).\r\n- Browse to the previously uncompressed folder using the \"cd\" command. e.g.:\r\n\r\n> cd Downloads\\CelestiaSunrise\r\n\r\n- Run the following command:\r\n\r\n> conda create -n celestiasunrise python=3\r\n\r\n- Run the following command:\r\n\r\n> conda install -n celestiasunrise pip\r\n\r\n- Run the following command:\r\n\r\n> activate celestiasunrise\r\n\r\n- Run the following command:\r\n\r\n> pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\n- Run the following command:\r\n\r\n> python CelestiaSunrise.py -g\r\n\r\n- Profit !\r\n\r\nNote that you will have to run the \"activate\" command each time you want to use this tool.\r\nYou find this complicated ? Take a look at [this](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/), or even better, at [this](http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/).\r\n\r\nBasic usage:\r\n> python CelestiaSunrise.py -g\r\n\r\nShell-like usage:\r\n> python CelestiaSunrise.py &lt;save_file&gt; &lt;encrypt_key&gt;\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nArzaroth (which is me)\r\n\r\nEvenprime (Original creator of [Luna's Dreamwalk](https://github.com/Evenprime/LunasDreamwalk))\r\n\r\n### Support or contact\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with this tool ?
